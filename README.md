# 3DSceneGenerationAndRegistration
This code generates a fake 3D scene, and simulates projection onto two cameras. The idea is to find the Roll, pich, yaw, Tx, Ty, Tz to align the depth scene with two other camera views. 


Please see the 3DSceneProjection.gif to see a visualization of the algorithm
